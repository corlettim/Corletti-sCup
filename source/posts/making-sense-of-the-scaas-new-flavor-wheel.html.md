A cookie that is unlike any other. It is far from your normal chocolate chip
cookies; it is a chocolate chip cookie with a twist. Chocolate chip is not the only
possible flavor for these delicious cookies. We can make any flavor from blueberry
for our fruit lovers to red velvet for our dessert lovers. They are a multipurpose
cookie that can be paired with a cup of coffee and make every day better!

## When they started

A mother's recipe is unforgettable, especially when it comes to biscotti. Within
the Corletti household, every other week was biscotti time. 3 or 4 batches were
made to fit everyone's preferences, from chocolate chip to cranberry walnut to
almond to lemon; all fields were covered. Our mom would get out the big glass mixing
bowl with our hand mixer and go to town, flour everywhere. As the dough was formed
onto the cookie sheet, the rest of the house had eyes wide waiting until the very
moment that we could grab the cookies and eat them once and for all. The baking
process is a lengthy one at that, at least when you are waiting until you can eat
them. Baked in the oven twice, to make sure that all the love is in every single
last cookie. Once cooled, into our mouths they went with little to no time to think.
The cookies were finished in the blink of an eye, only for us to turn around begging
for more. These cookies hold a special place in all of our hearts and in our bellies.
Which is exactly why we want to share them with you.
