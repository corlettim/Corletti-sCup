Corletti’s Cup is unique from other competitors due to our sourcing of coffee
beans from Happy Mug in Edinboro, PA. Our copartners ensure that every coffee
bean is organic and meets all fair trade standards. This protects coffee farmers
and helps to make sure every bean in your coffee is of the best quality.
