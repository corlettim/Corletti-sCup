  There is something different about the love in an Italian family. We would
  like to share our love with the rest of the world.

There is something to be said about the Corlettis. We have a love inside of us like
no other. We take the term family to be a ver serious obligation. The obligation
of having one another's back through whatever comes our way. The people you see
here in this picture have a fire within their hearts that burn brighter than
ever when all 5 members are together. We are a force to be reckon with and
nothing can come between us. We are each other's safe space, we are each other's
home.

## The Family Members

The Corletti name belongs to all 5 of us and while we have that stamp on us, we
all have different characteristics that make us one of a kind.

- Dan
- Beth
- Anthony
- Brian
- Megan
- Sadie (the puppy)

Dan (the man): Dan will be taking part in Corletti's Cup by offering his bouncer
like qualities and keeping the space safe. He is a friendly face and will more
than likely sit down with you to have a chat about your days. While Dan is not
very intimidating, he does take his job very seriously. He will also help guide
us when it comes to financial situations because he knows a thing or two about
money.

Beth (the boss): Beth, well...all we have to say about her is she will be the smiling
face when you walk through the door. Just kidding(love you Mom)!! Beth will not
only be that smiling face, but she will play a huge part in the behind the scenes
action when it comes to baked goods. After all, we get the recipes from her.

Anthony (the oldest): Tech man! Anthony is dedicated to taking our shop to the
next level by implementing technical and high level applications. These will range
from website design to square app readiness. This could get our business to a
ready mobile app to make ordering quicker and more accessible.

Brian (the rose between two thorns) and Megan (the youngest): Now, say hello
to the co-owners of Corletti's Cup! We got the passionate to create this little
coffee shop whenever we both decided to volunteer at our college campus coffee
shop.


If you ever see us in the space, be sure to say hi!
